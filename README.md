-----  PROJECT VISION  -----
I am aiming to write elegant code structure to make others easy to read and understand.
This Amazon web app is the demo to show what kind of Angular code skills I could write, it includes most of the shopping features, but not fully functional, I made some common on each page.

-----  ABOUT THIS WEBAPP -----
This app is developed by Angular 8 framework and Ionic 5 API, I referred to the structure of Amazon's official website.
It contains 10 pages and 1 service, user can create a account, login, add items to cart,
checkout.
